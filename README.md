# bilateralFilter

bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter for images. It replaces the intensity of each pixel with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels. 
In order to learn more about this project, please see "BF mini-project" pdf.

This repository will allow you to use bilateral filter on your own picture while adjusting the different parameters as you wish.

In order to change the parameters, please see "config.py" file.
In order to use your own photo, please add it to the "images" folder and make sure you change the image name in the config file.
